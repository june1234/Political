He then earned a B.A. in American Studies from Yale University (1969) and a J.D. from Southern Methodist University (1975).In 1969, Smith was hired as a management intern by the Small Business Administration in Washington, D.C. He was a business and financial writer for the Christian Science Monitor (1970\u20131972), was admitted to the Texas bar in 1975, and went into private practice in San Antonio with the firm of Maebius and Duncan, Inc.", "State politics": "In 1978, he was elected chairman of the Republican Party of Bexar County. In 1980, Smith was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing Bexar County, the 57th District. He served on the Energy Resources Committee and the Fire Ants Select Committee.

He won the general election with 61% of the vote.1988\u20132002During this time period, he never won re-election with less than 72% of the vote.2004Smith's district was significantly altered in the 2003 Texas redistricting.  While he lost most of the Hill Country to the 23rd District, he picked up a significant portion of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas, a traditional bastion of liberalism.  Smith won re-election with 62% of the vote, Smith's lowest winning percentage since his initial run in 1986.2006In 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States threw out the 23rd District in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry on the grounds that it violated the rights of Latino voters.  The 23rd is the largest district in the nation (not counting the at-large districts), stretching across 800 road miles from El Paso to San Antonio.  Due to its size, nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor had to be redrawn.  Smith regained most of the Hill Country, but kept a large portion of his share of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas.In November 2006 the Texas Legislative Council  found that nearly two-thirds of voters in District 21 cast ballots for statewide Republican candidates in 2004.

Running against him once more was Matt McCall, who drew 33,597 votes (28.9 percent). McCall polled 11,000 more votes than he did in 2014, but his percent went down because of higher turnout. Two other candidates held the remaining 11 percent of the ballots cast.Smith faced the Democrat Tom Wakely (born c. 1953) of San Antonio in the November 8 general election.  Smith (Republican) won with 57.0%;  Tom Wakely (Democratic)  got 36.5%;  Mark Loewe (Libertarian) got 4.1%; and Antonio Diaz (Green) got 2.4%.TenureAbortionSmith has consistently supported restrictions on abortion.

Under the current system, the space launch company is liable for any damages up to $500 million, after which the U.S. Government will pay the damages in the range of $500 million to $2.7 billion. Above $2.7 billion, the company is again responsible.STEM Education Act of 2014On July 8, 2014, Smith introduced the STEM Education Act of 2014 (H.R. 5031; 113th Congress), a bill that would add computer science to the definition of STEM fields used by the United States federal government in determining grants and education funding. Smith said that \"we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation's youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A health and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America.\"Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)On October 26, 2011, Smith introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act (H.R. 3261), also known as SOPA.

Representative Zoe Lofgren, (D-Calif.) and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) criticized PCIP.

He has been criticized for conducting \"witch hunts\" against climate scientists. In his capacity as Chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Smith issued more subpoenas in his first three years than the committee had for its entire 54-year history.
