Because of President George W. Bush's waning popularity, the race was expected to be competitive. The website MoveOn.org targeted Chocola and ran advertising against him. Chocola maintained a decisive lead in fundraising, raising $3.2 million to Donnelly's $1.5 million. The campaign was heated, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sponsoring ads attacking Chocola as beholden to moneyed interests in the insurance, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. Chocola returned fire by attacking Donnelly over a late tax filing and attempting to link him to liberal House leader Nancy Pelosi.On November 7, 2006, Donnelly defeated Chocola 54%-46%, a difference of 15,145 votes. The key difference between the 2006 and 2004 elections lay in the results in St. Joseph County, the location of South Bend and by far the district's largest county.

Donnelly fashioned himself \"a common-sense Hoosier in the tradition of Richard Lugar and Evan Bayh.Donnelly was endorsed by The Journal Gazette and the South Bend Tribune.During the campaign Mourdock became embroiled in a controversy after stating that pregnancy from rape is \"something that God intended.\" His remarks were made in a debate on October 23, 2012, during which he explained his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape.On November 6, 2012, Donnelly defeated Mourdock, 50% to 44%.Tenure On January 3, 2013, Donnelly was sworn into the United States Senate in the 113th Congress by Vice President Joe Biden.

According to FiveThirtyEight, which tracks Congressional votes, Donnelly has voted with President Trump's position 54.5% of the time. Congressional Quarterly published a study finding that Donnelly voted with Trump's positions 62% of the time.

In a speech at the 2012 Indiana Democratic Convention, Donnelly said that he would support a temporary one-year extension of all Bush-era tax cuts. \"Given our continued economic challenges,\" he said, \"now is the time to keep tax rates low...We need to create jobs, we need to help the middle class and support small businesses, and we need to avoid partisan bickering and delay.\"On September 27, 2013, Donnelly voted for the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59).In 2016, Donnelly received a rating of 10% from FreedomWorks and 15% from Club for Growth; in 2015-16, the National Tax Limitation Committee gave him a 36% rating.Donnelly opposed the Republican tax reform legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying in October 2017 that he was open to supporting the plan but wanted to see more detail and be assured it would focus on substantial middle-class tax relief.Financial regulationDuring his second term, Donnelly voted for the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.A March 2012 letter signed by Donnelly and other Democratic members of the House and Senate, urged Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler to curb oil speculation in the commodity market through new provisions in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.In July 2012 Donnelly voted in favor of H.R. 459, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, sponsored by Texas Congressman Ron Paul.

In 2018, Donnelly broke with the majority of his party and voted with Republicans to loosen banking regulations.Labor issuesIn 2007, Donnelly co-sponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The act allowed Congress to gradually raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. Donnelly voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Donnelly has pushed for the passage of the \"Forty Hours is Full Time Act\" along with Republican senator Susan Collins, which would define a full-time employment as 40 hours a week rather than 30.Health care Donnelly, along with 197 members of the House, was a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. He voted against the Prescription Drug Imports Act, which would have \"allowed funds to be used to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs by anyone who is not a legally sanctioned importer of drugs, a wholesaler, or a pharmacist.\"In 2007, Donnelly was a co-sponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP), which would have added $35 billion and 4 million children to the program over five years by raising the federal cigarette tax by 61 cents to $1 per pack.

Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed effort to override Bush's veto.In March 2010, Donnelly voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act). In 2013, Donnelly proposed changing the Affordable Care Act's definition of full-time work from 30 hours a week to 40. He also supported repealing the medical device excise tax, a 2.3% tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device. In 2012, Donnelly cosponsored the Protect Medical Innovation Act, which would repeal the tax.After Donnelly voted in 2012 to repeal the medical-device tax that is part of Obamacare, his 2012 election opponent, Richard Mourdock, said: \"Joe Donnelly wants to pick apart Obamacare, but that begs the question: Why didn't he just hold out and not vote for it?\"In 2017 campaign messages, Donnelly called President Donald Trump's proposed changes to Obamacare \"unacceptable and cruel\" and \"half-baked,\" asserting that Obamacare \"benefits millions of Hoosiers.\" In January 2018, Donnelly was one of six Democrats to join Republican senators in voting to confirm Alex Azar, Trump's nominee for Health Secretary.Education Donnelly opposed Trump's nomination of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. \"After reviewing her record,\" he explained, \"I share the concerns expressed by many Hoosier educators, students, and families that Betsy DeVos lacks the commitment to public education needed to effectively lead the Department of Education\".Foreign policy LibyaIn 2011 Donnelly voted to allow Department of Defense funds to be used for military actions as part of the NATO Intervention in Libya.

The Lee amendment would have prohibited the military spending any money in Afghanistan except for non-combat humanitarian activities, and on activities leading to the withdrawal of American military forces from the country.National security In 2011, Donnelly voted against H.R. 2219, which would have cut the U.S. military budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. These cuts would have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on weapons programs. Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, which would have cut $640 million in a 2% across-the-board reduction in spending from the 2012 United States Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.

He also voted to support expanded background checks that same year.In 2017, he participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster that was intended to persuade Republicans to support legislation that would have barred suspected terrorists and convicted criminals from purchasing guns. \"I am a supporter of the Second Amendment,\" he said. \"I'm also someone who believes it's reasonable for all of us to consider smart and responsible ways to reduce gun violence. Those things are not in opposition to each other.\" Despite Donnelly's participation in the filbuster, a liberal Donnelly supporter, Indianapolis Star columnist Matthew Tully, complained on June 15, 2016, that \"Donnelly's overall record on gun policies, first in the House and now in the Senate, and his general avoidance of taking a leadership position on the issue, seems much less tolerable than it did four years ago.\"Abortion Donnelly opposes abortion, and identifies as pro-life.

Planned Parenthood, which supports legal abortion, has given him a lifetime score of 67% in line with their positions.

In August 2015, his campaign treasurer, Kathy Davis, who had worked on a volunteer basis for four years, resigned from his campaign because he voted to defund Planned Parenthood after videos surfaced of Planned Parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue donations. He was one of only two Democratic Senators who voted to defund Planned Parenthood on this occasion, the other being Joe Manchin of West Virginia.On March 30, 2017, Donnelly voted against H.J. Res. 43, which, when signed by President Trump, nullified a pending federal regulation that would have disallowed states to withhold money from abortion providers.In November 2017, Donnelly was criticized by pro-life groups when he did not speak out against the DNC's presentation of a lifetime achievement award to the CEO of Planned Parenthood. \"Donnelly is making it clear that he's willing to get in line with the party on abortion to maintain his support from Washington Democrats,\" complained the NRSC.In 2018, he was one of three Democratic Senators who voted to ban abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy.LGBT issues Donnelly has an overall mixed voting record on LGBT rights, receiving a rating of 30% from the Human Rights Campaign in 2010.

In July 2017, the Associated Press reported that Donnelly, who had \"long blasted free-trade policies for killing American jobs\" and, specifically, \"railed against Carrier Corp. for moving manufacturing jobs to Mexico\" the previous year, had simultaneously \"profited from a family business\" that used Mexican labor. For over a year, the business, Stewart Superior Corp., which had been owned by his family \"for generations,\" had been \"shipping thousands of pounds of raw materials to Mexico\" and then transporting finished products back to the U.S. The company was run by Donnelly's brother, and Donnelly was a corporate officer and the firm's general counsel before entering Congress. In 2016, Donnelly owned up to $50,000 in company stock and between $15,001 and $50,000 in dividends. Alejandro Ruelas-Gossi, a Latin America trade expert, accused Donnelly of \"hypocrisy\" given his opposition to NAFTA. After the AP report, Donnelly agreed to sell his stock in the family firm.
