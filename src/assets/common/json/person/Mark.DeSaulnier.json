As a young man, DeSaulnier worked as a probation officer, a truck driver and a hotel services employee.[citation needed]DeSaulnier was a member of both the Teamsters International Union and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union.

A small businessman, DeSaulnier owned and operated several restaurants in the greater Bay Area before taking office in the Legislature in 2006.[citation needed]", "Personal life": "A member of the Concord Chamber of Commerce and the Contra Costa Council, DeSaulnier lives in Concord, California, where he raised his two sons. He is an avid runner and has completed twenty-one marathons.[citation needed]", "Early political career": "Local government DeSaulnier was appointed to the Concord Planning Commission in 1988.  In 1991, he was elected to the Concord City Council and served as mayor of Concord in 1993.  He was also a member of the University of California Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program Advisory Committee.[citation needed]In early 1994, Republican Governor Pete Wilson appointed DeSaulnier, then a fellow Republican, to the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors district 4, filling a vacancy caused by the resignation of Supervisor Sunne McPeak.  DeSaulnier served on the Board of Supervisors until 2006. He was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998 and 2002.  In June 1998, he received 98.4 percent of the vote against write-in candidates.In March 2002, he retained his seat with 79 percent of the vote against challenger Dione Mustard.Although the Board of Supervisors is a non-partisan office, DeSaulnier was active in Republican party affairs during much of his tenure as county supervisor. In September 1998, for example, he donated $200.00 to the United Republican Finance Committee of the Contra Costa County Republican Central Committee.During DeSaulnier's tenure on the Board of Supervisors, he sponsored the Industrial Safety Ordinance and the Refinery Flare Rule for local refineries and chemical facilities. DeSaulnier served on the executive boards of the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. He was appointed to represent the Bay Area on the California Air Resources Board by the Air District (1997\u20132006).[citation needed]As a member of the Air Resources Board, DeSaulnier supported strong environmental regulations, including cleaner-burning gasoline, lower-emission vehicles (LEVs), the identification of diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, dioxin monitoring in the Bay Area, the banning of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline, the identification of secondhand smoke as a carcinogen, the reduction of emissions from dairy farms, the phase-out of rice straw in the central valley and the reduction of emissions from cruise ships.[citation needed]On a county level, DeSaulnier introduced a Women's Health Program to serve the health-care needs of all women in Contra Costa County.  He also established the annual Children and Families' Budget, a separate County budget that reviews and measures the effectiveness of County programs in these areas. His other projects for children include AfterSchool4All, the Future Fund and the Children and Families Committee of the Board of Supervisors.[citation needed]The Contra Costa Times editorial board was critical of DeSaulnier's record as county supervisor.  An editorial published in 2009 stated, \"Many of the financial problems that afflict Contra Costa County today stem directly from decisions DeSaulnier championed while he was supervisor. Most notably, in 2002, at a time when the county faced a $31.5 million shortfall, was already laying off workers and was already experiencing increased public employee pension costs, DeSaulnier supported unsustainable pension increases that hiked benefits for public safety workers by as much as 50 percent. The plan allowed public safety workers to retire at age 50 with a pension worth 3 percent of their salary for each year served. Such excessive public employee union benefits have strained some local jurisdictions to the brink of bankruptcy.\"", "California State Assembly": "In the June 2006 Democratic primary, DeSaulnier carried 52 percent of the vote against Laura Canciamilla and two other opponents.

The bill was endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the California Police Chiefs Association, and opposed by the California Rifle and Pistol Association. It is not known if that required reporting time of 48 Hrs is from the point of time of discovery, or the point of time when the actual crime allegedly occurred.[citation needed]In November 2014, DeSaulnier was elected to represent California's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.
