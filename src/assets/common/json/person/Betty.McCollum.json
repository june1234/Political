Most of these groups have the same main goals. One example would be the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association which aims to provide access to \u201cfamily planning and reproductive health care services and to support reproductive freedom for all\u201d. She indicated on the 2002 National Political Awareness Test that she believed abortions should always be legally available, but only within the first trimester of pregnancy.The entire time Representative McCollum has been in office, she has supported gay civil rights. The Human Rights Campaign is America\u2019s largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality. They have continually approved of her voting record. In one speech opposing the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, she stated, \"Gay and lesbian Americans are citizens who must never be treated as second class citizens\".She has supported the interests of the elderly with regard to preserving social security.  She has supported organizations such as the Alliance for Retired Americans and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, who share the mission to ensure social and economic justice and full civil rights for all citizens so that they may enjoy lives of dignity, personal and family fulfillment and security.In a position paper, Representative McCollum defended her position on Social Security. She stated, \"We can secure the future of Social Security with common sense and a shared, bipartisan commitment to economic security and fiscal responsibility for all Americans. This is my commitment, and you can count on me to work to protect Social Security and to find a solution that truly protects the retirement security of every American.\" McCollum advocates shifting America's energy consumption to cleaner, non carbon based sources.

The amendment failed 148-241.

The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring Minneapolis-based 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her Republican opponent, State Senator Linda Runbeck, but Independence Party candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for Ramsey County (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.", "Electoral history": "2000 Fourth Congressional District of Minnesota ElectionsPartyCandidateVotes%\u00b1DemocraticBetty McCollum130,40348.04%\u2013RepublicanLinda Runbeck83,85230.89%\u2013IndependenceTom Foley55,89920.59%\u2013ConstitutionNicholas Skrivanek1,2850.47%\u20132002 Fourth Congressional District of Minnesota ElectionsPartyCandidateVotes%\u00b1DemocraticBetty McCollum164,59762.22%+14.18%RepublicanClyde Billington89,70533.91%\u2013GreenScott J.
