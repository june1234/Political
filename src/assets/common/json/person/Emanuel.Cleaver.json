He grew up in public housing in Wichita Falls, Texas. He graduated from Prairie View A&M University where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Cleaver then moved to Kansas City where he founded a branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and received a Master of Divinity degree from St. Paul School of Theology.Cleaver was the pastor at the St. James United Methodist Church in Kansas City Missouri from March 1972 until June 28, 2009.", "Early political career": "Cleaver served as Kansas City Councilman from 1979 to 1991 and as Mayor of Kansas City for two terms from 1991 until 1999. He was the first African American Mayor of Kansas City. During the last days of his tenure as Mayor, Reverend Cleaver agreed to an international visit to London, England. On the invitation of UK NGO Operation Black Vote he assisted in campaigning for increased electoral participation in the elections for the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. His visit culminated in a keynote speech at Westminster City Hall alongside British political figures including Ken Livingstone, Simon Hughes and Lee Jasper. Cleaver is a cousin to exiled Kansas City Black Panther leader Pete O'Neal. In 1997, Cleaver attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a pardon for O'Neal from President Bill Clinton.", "US House of Representatives": "After the compromise Budget Control Act deal had been reached to resolve the 2011 United States debt ceiling crisis in August 2011, Cleaver wrote on Twitter calling it a \"sugar-coated Satan sandwich.\"Committee assignments Committee on Financial ServicesSubcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity  (Ranking Member)Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and TechnologyCaucus membership Congressional Black CaucusTenure During his tenure, Cleaver has voted with the Democratic Party 95.8% of the time. He has been recognized as a congressman who is \"not shy about earmarks\" and has brought many tax dollars back to Kansas City.Cleaver has called for ethics charges against fellow U.S. Representatives Charlie Rangel and Maxine Waters to be dropped, saying \"The process has been tainted.\"Loan default On April 6, 2012, the Kansas City Star reported that Bank of America had sued Cleaver Company LLC over a commercial real estate loan for a Grandview car wash.

He was in Washington D.C. at the time and no staff members were present during the attack.", "Political campaigns": "In late 2003, Karen McCarthy, who had represented the 5th Congressional District since 1995, announced her retirement. Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former Clinton Administration official Jamie Metzl in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, Republican Jeanne Patterson made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri (behind the St. Louis-based 1st Congressional District). The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949. By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent of the vote in 2002.2008 Democratic Presidential Primary Election During the course of the contentious 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed Hillary Clinton. Cleaver claimed that African American superdelegates who supported Clinton were subjected to harassment, threatened with primary opponents and called \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d He said they were told, \u201cYou\u2019re not black if you\u2019re not supporting Barack Obama. \u2026 It's ugly.\u201d On March 30, 2008, he was interviewed on The Sunday Edition on CBC Radio and said he realized he was on the losing team: \"Even though I don't expect the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Indianapolis Colts, I cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs.\" According to BlackMissouri.com., U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois asked Cleaver, \u201cIf it comes down to the last day and you\u2019re the only superdelegate? \u2026 Do you want to go down in history as the one to prevent a black from winning the White House?\" \u201cI told him I\u2019d think about it,\" Cleaver explained. Cleaver said during the course of the primary he'd be shocked if Obama wasn't the next President but made it clear he still supported Clinton until she suspended her bid.", "Electoral History": "Kansas City Mayoral election, 1991PartyCandidateVotes%NonpartisanEmanuel Cleaver50,20453NonpartisanBob Lewellen43,98947Kansas City Mayoral election, 1995PartyCandidateVotes%NonpartisanEmanuel Cleaver51,05755NonpartisanDan Cofran41,024452004 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver161,72755.19RepublicanJeanne Patterson123,43142.12LibertarianRick Bailie5,8271.99ConstitutionDarin Rodenberg2,0400.702006 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver136,14964.25RepublicanJacob Turk68,45632.30LibertarianRandy Langkraehr7,3143.452008 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver197,24964.37RepublicanJacob Turk109,16635.632010 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver102,07653.32RepublicanJacob Turk84,57844.18LibertarianRandy Langkraehr3,0771.61ConstitutionDave Lay1,6920.882012 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver200,29060.52RepublicanJacob Turk122,14936.91LibertarianRandy Langkraehr8,4972.57Write-inOthers60.002014 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver79,25651.59RepublicanJacob Turk69,07144.96LibertarianRoy Welborn5,3083.462016 Election for U.S. Representative of Missouri's 5th Congressional DistrictPartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticEmanuel Cleaver190,76658.8RepublicanJacob Turk123,77138.2LibertarianRoy Welborn9,7333", "Personal life": "Emanuel Cleaver and his wife, Dianne, have four children.
