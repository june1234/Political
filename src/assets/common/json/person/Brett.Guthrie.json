{"name": "Brett.Guthrie", "picture": "G000558.jpg", "detail": {"Early life, education, and career": "Guthrie was born in Florence, Alabama, the son of Carolyn P. (n\u00e9e Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie. He earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematical economics from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1987 and his Master's of Public and Private Management from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1997.Guthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in Bowling Green. Guthrie has previously served as a field artillery officer in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.", "Kentucky Senate": "Guthrie represented the 32nd district in the Kentucky Senate from 1999 to 2008, where he served as vice chairman of the Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee, and was chairman of the Transportation Committee.", "US House of Representatives": "Elections 2008In the 2008 congressional general election, he defeated his Democratic opponent, State Senator David Boswell, for the right to succeed the retiring Republican U.S. Representative Ron Lewis. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie, however, filed his papers and defeated London for the party nomination.This set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years.  While Democrats have a large advantage in registration, the voters are very conservative on social issues.  This was a major reason Lewis had been able to hold on to the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election.  Ultimately, Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. Guthrie may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the Presidential election and the Senate election that were held at the same time. Republican candidate John McCain carried the district with 60 percent of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. The incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell also carried the 2nd district easily.2010The 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democrat Ed Marksberry by a large margin.2012Guthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.2018Guthrie filed for re-election on November 27, 2017.
