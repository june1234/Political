When Thune passed on the race to challenge Senator Tim Johnson, state Attorney General Mark Barnett and former Lieutenant Governor Steve T. Kirby quickly became candidates.However, the contest between Kirby and Barnett soon became very negative and dirty. Barnett attacked Kirby for not investing in companies based in South Dakota and for his involvement with Collagenesis, a company which removed skin from donated human cadavers and processed them for use. It became the subject of a massive scandal when it was revealed that the company was using the skins for much more lucrative cosmetic surgery like lip and penis enhancements while burn victims \"lie waiting in hospitals as nurses scour the country for skin to cover their wounds, even though skin is in plentiful supply for plastic surgeons\". Kirby invested in the company after the scandal broke and Barnett attacked him for it in television advertisements. However, the advertisements backfired because \"the claims were so outlandish, that people thought for sure that they were exaggerated or completely fabricated.\"After winning the Republican nomination, Rounds selected state senator Dennis Daugaard of Dell Rapids to be his running mate. Their Democratic opponents were University of South Dakota President Jim Abbott of Vermillion and his running mate, former state representative Mike Wilson of Rapid City.Rounds was elected governor on November 5, 2002. The results were as follows:Republicans: Mike Rounds and Dennis Daugaard\u2013 56.8%Democrats: Jim Abbott and Mike Wilson\u2013 41.9%Independent: Jim Carlson and Ron Bosch\u2013 0.7%Libertarians: Nathan Barton and Eric Risty\u2013 0.6%2006Two Democratic candidates emerged to challenge Rounds: Jack Billion, a retired surgeon and former state legislator from Sioux Falls and Dennis Wiese, the former president of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Billion easily defeated Wiese for the nomination and selected Rapid City school board member Eric Abrahamson as his running mate.The Rounds/Daugaard ticket was reelected on November 7, 2006. The results were as follows:Republicans: Mike Rounds and Dennis Daugaard \u2013 61.7%Democrats: Jack Billion and Eric Abrahamson \u2013 36.1%Constitution: Steven J. Willis and Larry Johnsen \u2013 1.2%Libertarians: Tom Gerber and Betty Rose Ryan \u2013 1.0%Tenure Rounds served as a member of the Governors' Council at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Rounds served as the 2008 Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association.Issues Research centers Rounds's 2010 Initiative established 10 research centers at state-supported universities.  In the first four years of the program, the state's first five research centers generated an estimated $59 million in federal and private funding, with an estimated $110 million economic impact for the state.Abortion On February 22, 2006, the state legislature of South Dakota passed an act banning all medical abortions except those necessary to save the mother's life (see double effect). Rounds signed the act on March 6 and the ban was to have taken effect on July 1, 2006, but never did because of a court challenge. A referendum for a potential repeal of H.B. 1215 was placed on the ballot for the November 2006 statewide election due to a successful petition. On May 30, over 38,000 signatures were filed, more than twice the 17,000 required to qualify. The law was ultimately repealed by voters on November 7, 2006, the day of Rounds' re-election.According to a Survey USA poll released in January 2006, Rounds had an approval rating of 73% and a net approval rating of +52%, which placed him among the top five most popular governors. Following the abortion ban, again according to a SurveyUSA poll, Rounds' approval rating dropped 14% to 58%; his approval rebounded to 70% after the ban was repealed.EB-5 Visa inquiry During Rounds' administration, the state offered green cards to foreign investors in exchange for investments in a new South Dakota beef packing plant and other economic investments through the EB-5 visa program established by the federal government in 1990. After the beef packing plant went bankrupt, questions emerged regarding the nature of the investments and the foreign investors. Some investors received neither their EB-5 visas nor the money back from their failed investments, with no indication as to where their money went.State officials misused funds to pay for their salaries, did not disclose that they owned companies which they gave contracts to, directed money towards companies that went bankrupt and arranged for loans from unknown sources from shell companies located in tax havens. In October 2014, Rounds admitted that he had approved a $1 million state loan to beef packing plant Northern Beef shortly after learning that Secretary of Tourism and State Development Richard Benda had agreed to join the company, with Benda then getting another $600,000 in state loans that was ultimately used to pay his own salary. Benda committed suicide in October 2013, days before a possible indictment over embezzlement and grand theft charges.3D printed weapons Regarding 3D printed weapons, Rounds has stated \u201cThis is a new technology which you\u2019re not going to put back into the bottle, it is there.\u201d His suggestion has been to \u201ccreate new technologies and utilize new technologies\u201d \u2014 such as metal detectors that could also recognize plastic \u2014 in schools, airports and other public places.", "US Senate": "2014 U.S. Senate election Speculation persisted that in 2008, Rounds would seek the United States Senate seat held at the time by Tim Johnson, a Democrat who had served since 1997. However, Rounds did not file to run against Johnson by the deadline, passing on the Senate race.[citation needed]Rounds launched a Senate campaign for 2014 on November 29, 2012 for the seat being vacated by Johnson's retirement.Rounds won the June 2014 Republican primary, defeating four other candidates. Early polls showed Rounds leading by a 2-1 margin against Democratic opponent Rick Weiland. Polls in October showed a closer three-way race between Rounds, Weiland, and independent former Senator Larry Pressler.Independent conservative former state legislator Gordon Howie was also in the race.Rounds ultimately won the four-way Senate race of 2014 with a majority of the votes cast. The results were as follows:Republican: Mike Rounds \u2013 50.37%Democrat: Rick Weiland \u2013 29.51%Independent: Larry Pressler \u2013 17.09%Independent: Gordon Howie \u2013 3.03%Positions EnvironmentIn 2017, Rounds was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Rounds has received over $200,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012. Rounds supported embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who had come under scrutiny because of extraordinary expenditures for personal security and luxury travel, and the appearances of ethical conflicts, defending him on Meet the Press. However, referring to the criticism as \"nitpicking,\" he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much of it is overblown and how much of it is accurate, to be honest.\u201dCommittee assignments Committee on Armed ServicesSubcommittee on AirlandSubcommittee on Readiness and Management SupportSubcommittee on SeapowerCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban AffairsSubcommittee on Economic PolicySubcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community DevelopmentSubcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer ProtectionCommittee on Environment and Public WorksSubcommittee on Fisheries, Water and WildlifeSubcommittee on Superfund, Waste Management, and Regulatory Oversight (Chair)Committee on Veterans' AffairsLegislation as primary sponsor S. 828: A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require the appropriate Federal banking agencies to treat certain municipal obligations as level 2B liquid assets, and for other purposes.S.2861 - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Medication Prescribing Improvement Act of 2016", "Personal life": "While attending South Dakota State University, Rounds met his wife, Jean, formerly of Lake Preston, South Dakota.
