Both pieces of legislation have been sent to the Senate for consideration. Johnson sponsored of H.R. 4036, the "Pass a Budget Now Act" which would cut the pay of legislators if a budget is not passed by April 15 of each year.AbortionIn a candidates\' questionnaire in 2010, Johnson wrote, "I am pro-life, and I oppose abortion except in the case of rape, incest, and when the mother\'s life is in danger.

After the federal courts struck down the initial executive order, Johnson supported a replacement executive order imposing a revised travel ban.Scott PruittIn April 2018, Johnson defended EPA head Scott Pruitt who at the time was embroiled in a number of investigations over ethics violations. While Pruitt was being grilled, largely along party lines, during an April 2018 hearing about the ethics concerns, Johnson said, "I think it\'s shameful today that this hearing has turned into a personal attack hearing and a shameful attempt to denigrate the work that\'s being done at the EPA and with this administration". Public officials should have ethical standards "beyond reproach ... but so should members of Congress", he added.Committee assignments Committee on Energy and CommerceSubcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and TradeSubcommittee on Environment and EconomySubcommittee on Oversight and InvestigationsUnited States House Committee on Science, Space and TechnologyUnited States House Science Subcommittee on SpaceCaucus memberships Congressional Arts CaucusCongressional Western CaucusLegislation sponsored Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 (H.R. 3588; 113th Congress) – Johnson introduced this bill into the House on November 21, 2013. The bill would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from requiring that all new fire hydrants in the United States be lead-free beginning in 2014.Johnson referred to the EPA\'s ruling as "absurd" and said that "it is unconscionable that the EPA has put our public safety at risk because during the hot summer months sometimes, somewhere kids may play in fire hydrant water."Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America (H.R. 2824; 113th Congress) – Johnson introduced this bill into the House on July 25, 2013.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will be good for jobs, save the government money, and improve U.S. energy production by  preventing the Obama Administration from introducing more coal regulations.Opponents of the bill described it as a bill that would require "OSM to implement the flawed 2008 Stream Buffer Zone rule and prevent the agency from improving that rule for a minimum of seven years."Improving Trauma Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 3548; 113th Congress) – Johnson introduced this bill into the House on November 20, 2013.
