A second attempt in 1986 also fell short, but he won in 1988.  He lost in 1990 after the legislature made his district somewhat friendlier to Democrats.  However, he returned in 1992.U. S. House of Representatives In 1994, 6th district Congressman Glenn English stepped down to become a lobbyist for rural electric cooperatives. Lucas won the Republican nomination for the special election on May 10. He faced Dan Webber, press secretary to former Governor and U.S. Senator David L. Boren, former president of the University of Oklahoma. The 6th was already by far the largest in the state, stretching from the Panhandle to the town of Spencer, in the far northeastern Oklahoma City metropolitan area. However, the state legislature had redrawn it so that it included many poor Oklahoma City neighborhoods that had never voted Republican. Lucas scored a major upset; he won by eight percentage points, carrying 18 of the district's 24 counties. His victory has been seen by some pundits as an early sign of the wave six months later that saw the Republicans take control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Lucas himself won a full term in that wave with 70 percent of the vote. He has been re-elected seven times, never dropping below 59 percent of the vote, and even ran unopposed in 2002 and 2004.Lucas' district was renumbered as the 3rd after Oklahoma lost a district in the 2000 Census. His already vast district was made even larger. He lost most of his share of Oklahoma City, which was home to 60 percent of the district's population. He once represented much of the downtown area, including the site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. He still represents that portion of the city located in Canadian County.  To make up for this large population loss, the 3rd was pushed further to the east, picking up the western portion of the Tulsa metro area (including a small portion of Tulsa itself) and some rural areas. As a result, his district now includes 48.5 percent of the state's landmass, and is nearly as large as the state's other four districts combined.2014 Republican primary In the 2014 Republican primary, Lucas won 83% of the vote. 12% went to Robert Hubbard; and 5% went to Timothy Ray Murray.", "Electoral history": "Oklahoma's 6th congressional district: Results 1992\u20132000YearDemocratVotesPctRepublicanVotesPct3rd PartyPartyVotesPct1992Glenn English *134,73468%Bob Anthony64,06832%1994Jeffrey S.
