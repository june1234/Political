Kihuen attended Rancho High School and was named the 1997\u20131998 Nevada \"soccer player of the year.\"He graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a Bachelor of Science degree in education. While in high school and college, Kihuen volunteered for the campaigns of Senator Harry Reid, Virginia Governor Mark Warner, and Houston Mayor Lee Brown.As of 2011, Kihuen was enrolled in the Master of Public Administration degree program at the University of Oklahoma.", "Early career": "In 2002, Kihuen became a deputy field director for the Nevada Democratic Party.

During the 76th legislative session in 2011 he was the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Economic Growth and Employment. In the 77th legislative session in 2013, he chaired the Senate Standing Committee on Revenue and Economic Development and served as Majority Whip for the Democrats in the Senate.", "US House of Representatives": "Elections 2012 In September 2011, Kihuen announced his intention to run to represent Nevada's 1st congressional district but withdrew a month before filing opened in February 2012, allowing former Representative Dina Titus to run without a contested primary.2016 On March 28, 2015, Kihuen announced he was running for Congress in Nevada's 4th congressional district, seeking to defeat first-term incumbent Republican Cresent Hardy. He defeated seven other candidates in the Democratic primary on June 14, 2016. Kihuen spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the only 2016 House recruit to do so. During the campaign, Kihuen was on leave from his job at the Las Vegas-based public relations firm the Ramirez Group. Kihuen won the election by a vote of 128,680 (48.5%) to 118,220 (44.5%).Kihuen defeated Hardy by just over 10,000 votes.

He was sworn in on January 3, 2017, becoming the first Hispanic to represent Nevada in the House of Representatives. He is also one of the first two Hispanics to represent the state in Congress; Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was sworn in the same day.Tenure Committee assignments Committee on Financial ServicesSubcommittee on Housing and InsuranceSubcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit FinanceCaucus memberships Congressional Hispanic CaucusCongressional LGBT Equality CaucusCongressional Progressive CaucusNew Democrat CoalitionCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus", "Sexual misconduct allegations": "On December 1, 2017, a 25-year-old woman who served as finance director of Kihuen's 2016 congressional campaign accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted touching.  The woman, who joined Kihuen's campaign in June 2015 and left in April 2016, alleges that Kihuen's behavior began in February, that he repeatedly requested that she go on dates or have sexual intercourse with him, and on two occasions forcibly touched her thighs without consent.Upon resigning from the campaign in April, the woman reported to a mid-level staffer at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that Kihuen had made her feel \"uncomfortable\", without offering any further details.  The mid-level staffer proceeded to confer with another mid-level staffer, who in turn called Kihuen's campaign manager, Dave Chase, and informed him of the woman's discomfort around Kihuen.  Chase then confronted Kihuen, who denied that anything had occurred.In addition to the finance director's conversation with the DCCC operative, she also documented Kihuen's behavior in a series of March 10, 2016 text messages to a friend, and shared contemporaneous details of her departure with four other individuals at the time. When asked about the accusations, Kihuen said, \"I sincerely apologize for anything that I may have said or done that made her feel uncomfortable\".On December 13, 2017, a second woman accused Kihuen of sexual misconduct. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Nevada Independent that he touched her thighs or butt in three separate incidents, and has sent her hundreds of sexually suggestive text messages. As of December 13, Kihuen has yet to deny or confirm the allegation to the Independent.Response The chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, demanded Kihuen's resignation immediately after being presented with the allegations by BuzzFeed on December 1, saying that \"If anyone is guilty of sexual harassment or sexual assault, they should not hold elected office, Congressman Kihuen should resign.\"Luj\u00e1n further punished Kihuen by ordering his immediate removal from the DCCC's Frontline program for incumbents in vulnerable seats.Luj\u00e1n was joined just after midnight on December 2 by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who called for Kihuen's resignation and declared that \"the young woman\u2019s documented account is convincing, and I commend her for the courage it took to come forward\".Nevada Democrats were quick to condemn Kihuen, although only Jacky Rosen, a fellow member of Congress, explicitly called for him to resign.  Aaron Ford, Kihuen's former leader in the Nevada State Senate, told reporters that he was \"deeply disappointed and disturbed\" by the allegations.  Perhaps the most scathing criticism came from Congresswoman Dina Titus, who said that \"many believed Ruben had great potential, but unfortunately his personal behavior has jeopardized his political career\" and that \"zero tolerance means zero tolerance. Ruben needs to step up and do what\u2019s right for the people of Nevada\".Chase, who managed Kihuen's successful campaign but did not join his Washington office, told BuzzFeed that he believes the former finance director, and wishes that he \"had known her specific allegations when I confronted Ruben after she left the campaign or in time to stop what took place\".Lucy Flores, who served alongside Kihuen in the Nevada Legislature and had been his Democratic primary opponent in 2016, said that she found the allegations unsurprising given his reputation in the legislature, where \"even though he maintained a girlfriend, he was known to be very flirtatious and hands on\" and that she had \"personally witnessed him being grabby with young, attractive women\".Later in the day on December 5, Kihuen gave his first interview since the allegations to ABC News, in which he declared his refusal to resign, instead saying that he \"finds it interesting\" that Pelosi, Lujan, and the DCCC \"knew about these allegations last year\".  Kihuen went on to say that the DCCC and party leadership had investigated the allegations, but that \"they didn't find anything, and they continued investing millions of dollars in my campaign\".  This was immediately denied by both Pelosi's office, which said that \"Leader Pelosi first learned of these allegations from BuzzFeed last week\", and the DCCC, who called Kihuen's statement \"not true\", adding that the DCCC had been \"presented with these disturbing facts for the first time last week, and the chair immediately called for his resignation\".On December 16, 2017, Kihuen announced that he would not seek re-election in 2018 but later claimed he was reconsidering this decision.", "introduction": "Rub\u00e9n Jes\u00fas Kihuen Bernal /\u02c8ru\u02d0b\u0259n \u02c8ki\u02d0w\u026an/ (born April 25, 1980) is an American politician from Nevada who is the U.S. Representative from Nevada's 4th congressional district.
