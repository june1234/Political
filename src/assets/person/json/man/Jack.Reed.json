He again denied interest, with a spokesman saying that \"Senator Reed loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate. He has made it very clear that he does not wish to be considered for Secretary of Defense or any other cabinet position. He just asked the people of Rhode Island to hire him for another six year term and plans on honoring that commitment.\"On November 24, 2014, Ted Nesi of WPRI-TV noted the reasons that Reed continues to turn down the job, citing his \"safe seat\", his status as one of the most popular politicians in the state, his fondness for working in the Senate and his passion for housing policy. He concluded that \"no matter how many times Reed's aides privately groan about another flareup of defense secretary speculation, they surely appreciate that each recurrence is a sign of the senator's positive reputation in Washington and Obama's esteem for him.\"Committee assignments Committee on Armed Services (Ranking Member)Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and CapabilitiesSubcommittee on SeapowerSubcommittee on Strategic ForcesCommittee on AppropriationsSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related AgenciesSubcommittee on DefenseSubcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related AgenciesSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related AgenciesSubcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related AgenciesSubcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban AffairsSubcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer ProtectionSubcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community DevelopmentSubcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and InvestmentSelect Committee on Intelligence (ex officio)Caucus memberships Afterschool Caucuses", "Political positions": "Since his election to Congress, Reed has consistently voted in a similar manner to other New England Democrats, holding generally liberal positions on social and economic issues.
