He is a past editor of the Harvard Law Review.', 'Maryland legislature': 'In November 2006, he was elected as a Maryland State Senator for District 20, representing parts of Silver Spring and Takoma Park in Montgomery County. In 2012 he was named the Majority Whip for the Senate, and was the Chairman of the Montgomery County Senate Delegation, Chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics Reform, and a Member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee.Raskin was a strong proponent of liberal issues in the Maryland Senate. He has been the sponsor of bills advocating same-sex marriage, the repeal of the death penalty in Maryland, the expansion of the state Ignition interlock device program, and the establishment of the legal guidelines for Benefit Corporations, a corporate form for-profit entities that wish to consider a material societal benefit in their bylaws and decision making process.A former board member of FairVote, Raskin introduced and sponsored the first bill in the country for the National Popular Vote, a plan for an interstate compact to provide for the first popular presidential election in American history.On March 1, 2006, during a Maryland State Senate hearing regarding same-sex marriage, Raskin, speaking as a constitutional law expert, told a lawmaker, "People place their hand on the Bible and swear to uphold the Constitution; they don\'t put their hand on the Constitution and swear to uphold the Bible."Raskin also introduced Senate legislation to legalize medical marijuana in Maryland in 2014. The bill was signed by Martin O\'Malley and went into effect in January 2015.', 'US House of Representatives': '2016 campaign The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post reported that Raskin announced his campaign on April 19, 2015, stating that, "[m]y ambition is not to be in the political center, it is to be in the moral center." The district\'s seven-term incumbent, fellow Democrat Chris Van Hollen, gave up the seat to make an ultimately successful run for the United States Senate.Raskin won the crowded seven-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 33 percent of the vote. The primary election was the most expensive House race in 2016. He won the general election, defeating Republican Dan Cox with 60 percent of the vote.Tenure In his first action as a Congressman, Raskin, with several other members of House of Representatives, objected to certifying the election of Donald Trump as President because of Russian interference in the election and voter suppression efforts. Vice President Joseph Biden ruled the objection out of order because it had to be sponsored by at least one member of each chamber, and there was no Senate sponsor.In late June 2017 Raskin was the chief sponsor of legislation to establish a congressional "oversight" commission with the authority to declare a President "incapacitated" and removed from office under the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.In April 2018, Raskin, together with Jared Huffman, Jerry McNerney, and Dan Kildee, launched the Congressional Freethought Caucus. Its stated goals include "pushing public policy formed on the basis of reason, science, and moral values", promoting the "separation of church and state," opposing discrimination against "atheists, agnostics, humanists, seekers, religious and nonreligious persons", among others. Huffman and Raskin will act as co-chairs.Committee assignments Committee on House AdministrationCommittee on the Judiciary (Vice-Ranking Member)Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil JusticeSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and InvestigationsCommittee on Oversight and Government ReformSubcommittee on Information TechnologySubcommittee on Interior, Energy and EnvironmentParty leadership and caucus membership House Democratic Caucus, Senior WhipHouse Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, Freshman RepresentativeCongressional Progressive Caucus, Vice Chair and Liaison to New MembersCongressional LGBT Equality CaucusHouse Pro-Choice CaucusHouse Public Education CaucusHouse Quiet Skies CaucusHouse 115th Class CaucusHouse Baltic CaucusCongressional Freethought CaucusCongressional Asian Pacific American CaucusCongressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus', 'Electoral history': 'Democratic primary, Congress, Maryland 8th district, 2016PartyCandidateVotes%DemocraticJamie Raskin43,77633.6%DemocraticDavid Trone35,40027.1%DemocraticKathleen Matthews31,18623.9%DemocraticAna Sol Gutierrez7,1855.5%DemocraticWilliam Jawando6,0584.6%DemocraticKumar P.
