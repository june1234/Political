{'name': 'John.Cornyn', 'picture': 'C001056.jpg', 'detail': {'Early life, education, and legal career': "Cornyn was born in Houston, the son of Atholene Gale Cornyn (née Danley) and John Cornyn\xa0II, a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. While growing up, he attended the American School in Japan after his family moved to Tokyo in 1968, and graduated from there in 1969. He graduated from Trinity University in 1973, where he majored in journalism and was a member of Chi Delta Tau. He earned a J.D. from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1977 and an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995. He was named the St. Mary's Distinguished Law School Graduate in 1994 and a Trinity University Distinguished Alumnus in 2001.He served in San Antonio for six years as a district judge before being elected as a Republican in 1990 to the Texas Supreme Court, on which he served for seven years.", 'Attorney General': "1998 election In 1998, Cornyn decided to run to become Texas Attorney General. In the March primary, Barry Williamson, Railroad Commissioner, placed first with 38% of the vote but failed to get the 50% threshold necessary to win the Republican nomination. Cornyn, then a state Supreme Court Justice, got second place with 32%. In the April run-off election, Cornyn defeated Williamson 58% to 42%. In the general election, Cornyn defeated Jim Mattox, former attorney general (1983–1991) and U.S. Congressman, with 54% of the vote. In 1998, Senator Cornyn became the first Republican elected Attorney General of Texas since Reconstruction and was sworn in by Governor George W. Bush.Tenure He created the Texas Internet Bureau to investigate illegal internet practices. He fought against government waste and corruption with his investigation of fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims.Cornyn was criticized for failing to investigate in a timely manner the false drug convictions of numerous African-Americans in Tulia, Texas. An Austin Chronicle article on September 6, 2002, said that Cornyn announced that his office will investigate the 1999 drug bust, where the accused  represented 16% of the town's black population.In 2005, Cornyn's name was mentioned among possibilities to replace Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O'Connor or William Rehnquist.", 'United States Senate': 'Elections 2002In the 2002 U.S. Senate Primary in Texas, Cornyn was the candidate promoted and supported by the Texas Republican Party. He easily defeated the five other candidates in the Republican Primary while disdaining the opportunity to debate the other candidates. Cornyn defeated his closest Republican challenger, Bruce Rusty Lang, a self-financed Dallas-based international physician, in the Republican Primary election by a ten to one electoral margin. In the 2002 General election, Cornyn defeated Democrat Ron Kirk in a campaign that cost each candidate over $9 million. Cornyn\'s predecessor, Phil Gramm, resigned early, effective November 30, 2002, so that Senator-Elect Cornyn could take office early, and move into Gramm\'s office suite in order to begin organizing his staff. Cornyn did not, however, gain seniority, owing to a 1980 Rules Committee policy that no longer gave seniority to senators who entered Congress early for the purpose of gaining advantageous office space.2008Texas has not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, and according to Rasmussen polling, in October 2008 Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%. Texas House of Representatives member/Afghanistan War veteran Rick Noriega secured his place as Cornyn\'s Democratic challenger in the March 4 primary, beating out opponents Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega 47% to 43%, suggesting that this race might have proved to be unexpectedly competitive. However, most polls showed a much wider margin. Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield, was a Republican challenger for the March 2008 primary election, but Cornyn easily won the Republican Primary.Yvonne Adams Schick was the Libertarian Party\'s nominee. In addition, the Green Party of Texas sought ballot access for its candidate David B. Collins.2014Cornyn succeeded in his reelection in 2014. Cornyn, according to the Dallas Morning News, "never broke a sweat." He won the Republican primary with 59% of the vote against Houston-area congressman Steve Stockman in the March primary. In the general election he raised $14 million, outspending nearly 3-1 Democrat David Alameel, a Dallas resident.Tenure In 2004, Cornyn co-founded and became the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate India Caucus. Cornyn was selected by his colleagues in December 2006 to be a member of the five-person Republican Senate leadership team as Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.Cornyn has received various awards and recognitions, including the 2005 Border Texan of the Year Award; the National Child Support Enforcement Association\'s Children\'s Champion Award; the American Farm Bureau Federation\'s Friend of Farm Bureau Award; the Texas Association of Business\'s (TAB) Fighter for Free Enterprise Award; the National Federation of Independent Business\'s (NFIB) Guardian of Small Business Award; the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders\'s (CONLAMIC) Latino Leadership Award; and the Texas Association of Mexican American Chambers of Commerce\'s (TAMACC) International Leadership Legislative Award; among others.[citation needed]In 2005, Cornyn gained notice by connecting the Supreme Court\'s reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo\'s life with the recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow\'s husband and mother as well as the courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. Cornyn said: "I don\'t know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and building up to the point where some people engage in violence". His statement and a similar one by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay were widely denounced, including by The New York Times. Cornyn later said that the statement was taken out of context and for that reason he regretted the statement.In 2005, the Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Cornyn and Senator Patrick Leahy with its first ever Bi-Partisan Leadership Award in honor of their cooperation on issues of government oversight and transparency, including their co-sponsorship of the OPEN Government Act of 2005, which prevented burying exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act in legislation.On May 18, 2007, Cornyn was involved in an altercation with the late Senator John McCain. During a meeting on immigration, McCain and Cornyn had a shouting match when Cornyn started questioning the number of judicial appeals that illegal immigrants could receive. McCain yelled an insult at Cornyn and said "I know more about this than anyone else in the room." Previously, Cornyn told McCain, "Wait a second here. I\'ve been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day. You\'re out of line." Cornyn has been described by Jim Jubak of MSN Money as one of "Big Oil\'s ten favorite members of Congress", as he has received more money from the oil and gas industry than all but six other members of Congress.On the day of Obama\'s inauguration, it was reported that Cornyn would prevent Hillary Clinton from being confirmed as secretary of state by a unanimous floor vote that day. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\'s spokesman reported to the Associated Press that a roll call vote would be held instead on the following day, January 21, 2009, for the Clinton confirmation and that it was expected Clinton would "receive overwhelming bipartisan support". The vote was 94–2 in her favor, with only Senators Jim DeMint (R-SC) and David Vitter (R-LA) voting in opposition.As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cornyn was a strong supporter of Norm Coleman\'s various court challenges to the 2008 election certification of the Minnesota U.S. Senate race. Cornyn advocated for Coleman to bring the case before the federal court, and had said the trial and appeals could take years to complete. Cornyn had threatened that Republicans would wage a "World War\xa0III" if the Senate Democrats had attempted to seat Democratic candidate Al Franken before the appeals were complete. Coleman conceded after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favor of Democratic candidate Al Franken.Senate Majority Whip On November 14, 2012, Cornyn was elected Senate Minority Whip by his peers.Cornyn was named Senate Majority Whip after 2014 election, during which the Republican Party took control of the Senate.In February 2013, Cornyn became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.After the death of Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, Cornyn said that any nominee by Obama would have a difficult confirmation process and would feel like a piñata. He also stated that no serious candidate would accept a nomination before they would know that they would not be confirmed. When Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, Cornyn said that even if the president has the constitutional authority to nominate someone, the Senate has full authority on how to proceed afterwards. Cornyn also said that the voice of the people should play a role and that the vacancy should be filled by the winner of the upcoming presidential election, so no hearings on Garland would be held.On June 8, 2017, Cornyn questioned James Comey on Hillary\'s Clinton\'s emails at a committee hearing whose announced topic was the Russian interference in the 2016 election and Comey\'s dismissal as FBI director.In September 2018, during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, Cornyn accused the Democrats sitting on the Judiciary Committee of descending into mob rule by breaking the rules of decorum when asking for postponement or adjournment of the hearing to obtain or review documents from Kavanaugh\'s time during his time working for the George W. Bush administration. Cornyn said that it was hard to find the Democrats\' claim that they could not properly assess Kavanaugh without the documents credible because it seemed like their minds had been made up beforehand.Committee assignments United States Senate Select Committee on IntelligenceCommittee on FinanceSubcommittee on Health CareSubcommittee on Taxation, IRS Oversight, and Long-Term GrowthSubcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and InfrastructureCommittee on the JudiciarySubcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer RightsSubcommittee on the ConstitutionSubcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security (Chairman)Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland SecurityCurrent legislation BILL S.2066 - 114th Congress (2015–2016)RESOLUTION S.Res.259 - 114th Congress (2015–2016) RESOLUTION S.J.Res.22 - 114th Congress (2015–2016)', 'Political positions': 'Cornyn was ranked by National Journal as the fourteenth-most conservative United States Senator in their 2013 rankings. He was considered by The Dallas Morning News to be a reliable ally of former President George W. Bush on most issues.Civil rights and law enforcement In the 2004 debate surrounding the Federal Marriage Amendment, Cornyn released an advance copy of a speech he was to give at The Heritage Foundation. In the speech, he wrote, "It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right... Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife". According to his office, he removed the reference to the box turtle in the actual speech, but The Washington Post ran the quote, as did The Daily Show.Cornyn sponsored a bill that would allow law enforcement to force anyone arrested or detained by federal authorities to provide samples of their DNA, which would be recorded in a central database. He voted to recommend a constitutional ban on flag desecration and for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He also voted for the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act and extending its wiretap provision.Climate change Cornyn was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement.Defense and homeland security Cornyn was one of only 22 Senators to vote against the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 that expands the educational benefits for soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, he co-sponsored S. 2938, which gives benefits that are dependent on length of service.In August 2012, following news reports that a Russian Akula-class nuclear-powered submarine operated in the Gulf of Mexico purportedly undetected for over a month, Cornyn demanded details of this deployment from Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations.In 2013 Cornyn said that, despite the sequester, the Pentagon would actually see its budget increase.Social policy He voted to ban intact dilation and extraction (a procedure also known as "partial-birth abortion") except in cases where the mother\'s life was in danger, and for a criminal penalty for harming a fetus while committing another crime. He also voted in favor of notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions. He voted against expanding research to more embryonic stem cell lines. He voted to prevent contributions to organizations that provide abortion as a component of family planning, and to prevent funding of organizations that support coercive abortion.Cornyn voted to confirm Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States. In September 2005, during the Supreme Court hearings for Roberts, Cornyn\'s staff passed out bingo cards to reporters. He asked them to stamp their card every time a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee used terms such as "far right" or "extremist".On July 24, 2009, Cornyn announced his intention to vote against President Barack Obama\'s Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, citing his opinion that she might rule "from a liberal, activist perspective".Fiscal policy In 2018, Cornyn voted for the Omnibus bill H.R. 1625 which is projected to add $1.3 Trillion to the US deficit.Cornyn voted to permanently repeal the estate tax and for raising the estate tax exemption to $5 million.

Cornyn stated that Senator Cruz\'s efforts to defund Obamacare by threatening to default on the U.S. Government\'s debt obligations were "unachievable", saying "the shutdown did not help our cause. What did help our cause was the president\'s implementation of Obamacare, which has overwhelmed everything else. I don\'t hear anyone thinking that another government shutdown is the way to achieve our goals." Cornyn joined other Republican leaders to block fellow Texas Senator Ted Cruz\'s procedural move to reject an increase in the debt ceiling.Gun rights In April 2013, Senator Cornyn was one of 46 senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all buyers. Cornyn voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the passage of the bill.In January 2014, Senator Cornyn introduced the "Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act". The bill would provide interstate reciprocity for persons with concealed weapons permits. Cornyn described the bill as "It\'s like a driver\'s license. It doesn\'t trump state laws. Say you have a carry permit in Texas; then you use it in another state that has a concealed-carry law." He was rated "A" by the National Rifle Association (NRA) as of 2003 and 2014; as of 2018 his NRA rating was "A+". Cornyn has continued to support Concealed Carry Reciprocity as of the year of 2018, with the Republican-held House of Representatives passing a bill in late 2017 with this language attached to gun control measures from the Senate\'s Fix NICS bill.Victims\' rights Senator John Cornyn has long been opposed to anyone profiting from memorabilia tied to convicted murderers, and had made three attempts thus far to pass acts against this. He introduced his first "Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act" in 2007, which died in committee. He then revived it three years later with cosponsor Amy Klobuchar. The 2010 version of the "Murderabilia" bill met the same fate as the first.In 2013, inspired by a Nidal Hasan letter put up for sale by artist Kelly Hutchison, Cornyn decided to continue working on his bill. The listing claimed that all proceeds would be donated to charity, and the letter was reported to have sold anywhere from $2000 USD to $500,000 USD by various news sources.', 'Electoral history': 'United States Senate election in Texas, 2014PartyCandidateVotes%RepublicanJohn Cornyn2,855,06862DemocraticDavid Alameel1,594,25234LibertarianRebecca Paddock133,4673GreenEmily Marie Sanchez54,5871IndependentMohammed Tahiro1,178<1Majority1,022,81422Total votes4,638,552100Turnout33Republican holdUnited States Senate Republican primary election in Texas, 2014PartyCandidateVotes%RepublicanJohn Cornyn (incumbent)781,25959RepublicanSteve Stockman251,57719RepublicanDwayne Stovall140,79411RepublicanLinda Vega50,0574RepublicanKen Cope34,4093RepublicanChris Mapp23,5352RepublicanReid Reasor20,6002RepublicanCurt Cleaver12,3251Texas U.S. Senate Election 2008PartyCandidateVotes%±RepublicanJohn Cornyn (incumbent)4,326,63955DemocraticRick Noriega3,383,89043LibertarianYvonne Adams Schick184,7292Texas U.S. Senate Republican Primary Election 2008PartyCandidateVotes%+%RepublicanJohn Cornyn (incumbent)997,21681RepublicanLarry Kilgore226,64919Texas U.S. Senate Election 2002PartyCandidateVotes%±RepublicanJohn Cornyn2,480,99155DemocraticRon Kirk1,946,68143LibertarianScott Jameson35,5381GreenRoy Williams25,051<1Texas U.S. Senate Republican Primary Election 2002PartyCandidateVotes%+%RepublicanJohn Cornyn478,82577RepublicanBruce Rusty Lang46,9078RepublicanDouglas Deffenbaugh43,6117RepublicanDudley Mooney32,2025RepublicanLawrence Cranberg17,7573Texas Attorney General Election 1998PartyCandidateVotes%+%RepublicanJohn Cornyn2,002,79454DemocraticJim Mattox1,631,04544LibertarianMike Angwin57,6042Texas Attorney General Republican Primary Runoff Election 1998PartyCandidateVotes%+%RepublicanJohn Cornyn135,13058RepublicanBarry Williamson98,21842Texas Attorney General Republican Primary Election 1998PartyCandidateVotes%+%RepublicanBarry Williamson208,34538RepublicanJohn Cornyn176,26932RepublicanTom Pauken162,18030Texas Associate Justice Supreme Court Election 1996PartyCandidateVotes%+%RepublicanJohn Cornyn (incumbent)2,686,51852DemocraticPatrice Barron2,351,75046LibertarianThomas Stults129,2032', 'Personal life': 'Cornyn and his wife, Sandy Hansen, have two daughters.Cornyn gained national attention when he released a video referring to himself as "Big Bad John."
