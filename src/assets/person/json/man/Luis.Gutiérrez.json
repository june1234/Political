{"name": "Luis.Guti\u00e9rrez", "picture": "", "detail": {"Early life, education, and early career": "Guti\u00e9rrez was born and raised in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, then an immigrant and working-class community. His mother was an assembly-line worker, and his father was a cab driver. After his freshman year at St. Michael's High School, his parents moved the family to their hometown of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico. Guti\u00e9rrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there, he learned to speak Spanish. Guti\u00e9rrez said of his experience moving from Chicago to Puerto Rico: \"In Lincoln Park, I had been called a spic, then, all of a sudden, I land on the island and everyone calls me gringo and Americanito. I learned to speak Spanish well.\"According to Mark Krikorian, while Guti\u00e9rrez was in Puerto Rico, he was a member of the now-defunct Puerto Rican Socialist Party.In 1974, Guti\u00e9rrez returned to Chicago and enrolled at Northeastern Illinois University. He got involved in student activism and social justice issues, writing for the student publication Que Ondee Sola and serving as the president of the Union for Puerto Rican Students. In 1976, while a senior at Northeastern Illinois, he began driving a cab in order to raise enough funds to visit his long-time girlfriend, Soraida, in Puerto Rico. In 1977, after graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in English, he returned to Puerto Rico and married Soraida. The couple returned to Chicago in 1978, and, unable to find other work, Guti\u00e9rrez took up taxi driving full-time. Guti\u00e9rrez eventually found work as a Chicago Public School teacher and later a child abuse caseworker with the Illinois Department of Children & Family Services.", "Early political career": "Campaign for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman In 1983, Guti\u00e9rrez left his job with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to run against incumbent Dan Rostenkowski for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman in the March 1984 primary election. To fund his campaign, Guti\u00e9rrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Guti\u00e9rrez's work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars. Reporting on Guti\u00e9rrez's early political career, Jorge Casuso and Ben Joravsky of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \"Guti\u00e9rrez thought he could win. Washington's 1983 victory \u2013 the first local race Guti\u00e9rrez had voted in \u2013 had left him wildly optimistic. Before that, he didn't think blacks, Hispanics and poor people could win a legitimate voice in local government.\"Relying on his family and friends as campaign staff, Guti\u00e9rrez opened up his campaign office on North California Ave in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood. Guti\u00e9rrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to qualify for the ballot on his own. Rostenkowski, then a twelve-term Congressman and Chair of the powerful House Ways & Means Committee soundly defeated Guti\u00e9rrez, with 76% of the vote.Adviser to Harold Washington Following Guti\u00e9rrez's loss to Dan Rostenkowski, he helped found the Cook County Coalition for New Politics in spring of 1984. The coalition was meant to be a grass-roots, independent, and multiracial counterweight to the Cook County Democratic Party.Guti\u00e9rrez's political activism and role as a rising leader in Chicago's burgeoning Latino community caught the attention of Chicago's first African-American Mayor \u2013 Harold Washington \u2013 who appointed him in August 1984 to the position of deputy superintendent in the Department of Streets and Sanitation.Guti\u00e9rrez served as a deputy superintendent in the Washington administration and as an administrative assistant to the Mayor \u2013 serving on the Mayor's committee on infrastructure.In October 1984, a Molotov cocktail came crashing through the front living room window of Guti\u00e9rrez's home. For a period of three months following the firebombing, his family lived in hotel rooms. The offenders were never identified, but Guti\u00e9rrez attributed the attack to \"culprits from the right... opposed to reform and Mayor Washington\".In July 1985, in an effort to support Washington's political reform movement, Guti\u00e9rrez founded the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization (IPO). Like the Cook County Coalition for New Politics, the organization aimed to bring together residents of all races in support of progressive reform in Chicago. The Mayor attended the organization's kick-off event, at which 100 names were added to the mailing list and $5,000 was raised.1986 Aldermanic election In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, district court judge Charles Norgle ordered a special election for March 18, 1986, in seven wards, including the 26th. The incumbent alderman of the 26th ward, Michael Nardulli, an Italian-American, chose not to seek re-election in the newly drawn majority Latino district. Guti\u00e9rrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington. At the time of the election, opponents to Washington's administration, led by Ed Vrdolyak of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council. This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as Council Wars. The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council. Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward. Manuel Torres, then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner, also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman. Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor Jane Byrne, future mayor and then State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, and machine Alderman Ed Burke and Dick Mell.Guti\u00e9rrez's campaign volunteers were primarily women, \"ex-hippies and... community activists-black, white and Hispanic\". With the campaign theme: \"Church, Family, Community\", support from Mayor Harold Washington \u2013 who donated $12,000 to Guti\u00e9rrez \u2013 and the now 250 members of the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization as volunteers, Guti\u00e9rrez bested Torres by 22 votes, a margin not large enough to avoid a run-off against Torres.On the eve of the Guti\u00e9rrez-Torres run-off, Spanish language television aired the candidates' final debate. Guti\u00e9rrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Guti\u00e9rrez's use of Spanish and his grass-roots organizing are credited for his 53%\u201347% victory over Torres. Guti\u00e9rrez is reported to have said during the election: \"My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party. They're ready to work on whatever it is that moves socioeconomic justice ahead.\"Chicago City Council Upon entering the Chicago City Council, Guti\u00e9rrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington's unofficial floor leader, and leader of the Latinos in the council. Guti\u00e9rrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: \"There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five [pro-Washington alderman] that say anything. You could say there's only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time. But I figured it out-there's only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have anything on, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't taken care of some problem, that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have some dirt on. So, when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean.\"As a member of the city council, Guti\u00e9rrez was a key backer of the 1986 gay rights ordinance \u2013 which sought to ban discrimination based upon gender & sexual orientation. He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing. He was referred to as a \"workhorse in the city council\" by political author Marable Manning.In the 1987 municipal elections, Guti\u00e9rrez faced five opponents and was re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote. Following Washington's death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Guti\u00e9rrez voted for African-American Alderman Timothy C. Evans over machine-backed Alderman Eugene Sawyer. In the 1989 Mayoral election, Guti\u00e9rrez endorsed State's Attorney Richard M. Daley for Mayor, stating: \"I will have a great influence in determining the thrust and tone of the Daley administration`s progressive and liberal agendas.\"Under Daley's administration, Guti\u00e9rrez served as Chair of the Committee on Housing, Land Acquisition, Disposition, and Leases and Council President pro tempore, presiding over meetings in the Mayor's absence.", "US House of Representatives": "Elections Election (1992)In 1990, a court order created a new \"earmuff-shaped\" majority Latino congressional district, with two main sections in Chicago connected by a thin corridor in the suburbs. Four candidates announced their intention to run in the 1992 Democratic primary: Guti\u00e9rrez, Alderman Dick Mell of the 33rd ward, then Cook County Board of Appeals Commissioner Joseph Berrios, and Juan Soliz, former Alderman of 25th ward. Mell, the only white candidate, entered the race out of his \"personal dislike for Guti\u00e9rrez\". Guti\u00e9rrez received the endorsement of Mayor Richard M. Daley, and all but one of his opponents, Juan Soliz, dropped out of the race.Despite the district's majority Mexican-American population and Soliz's highly negative campaign, Guti\u00e9rrez won the Democratic primary 60%-40%. At his election night victory party, Guti\u00e9rrez stated: \"If a Puerto Rican kid from Humboldt Park can go to the Congress of the United States, it shows the American dream is possible.\" Billy Ocasio was later tapped to replace Gutierrez in the Chicago City Council in January 1993. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Hildegarde Rodriguez-Schieman 78%-22%. However, the 4th is a heavily Democratic district, and Guti\u00e9rrez had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his primary win.Re-elections (1994-2010)In 1994, Gutierrez defeated Soliz in the primary by an even larger margin 64%-36%, and won re-election to a second term in the general election with 75% of the vote. It would prove to be the lowest winning percentage in a general election in his career. From 1996 to 2008, Guti\u00e9rrez won re-election seven times, each time with more than 80% of the vote. In 2010, he won re-election to his tenth term with 77% of the vote.Gutierrez pulled his petition for re-election in the 2018 race on November 27, 2017, effectively ending his congressional career. The next day Gutierrez held a press conference, he endorsed Cook County Commissioner Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda for the position. He did not rule out running for a future office.Tenure Party leadership and Caucus membership In 2009, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi appointed Guti\u00e9rrez Chair of the Democratic Caucus Immigration Task Force. He continues to serve as the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus  Immigration Task Force. In these roles, he has served as the Congress's \"leading strategist and spokesperson on immigration issues\".Constituent services  The representative of a culturally diverse district, he has run programs on a local level to increase education levels and knowledge of the English language among immigrants. Within his district, he has run workshops which have helped more than 50,000 people begin the process of becoming US citizens. Guti\u00e9rrez's district office was the first congressional office to seek and receive community organization designation as a result of the depth and breadth of constituent services it provides.Consumer rights This biography of a living person relies too much on references to primary sources.

H.R. 1214 would cap the annual percentage rate (APR) for payday loans at 391 percent in the 23 states where it is now allowed to exceed 391 percent.Guti\u00e9rrez was also a principal backer of the Dodd-Frank bill that created the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Immigration reform and immigrant rights Guti\u00e9rrez has been called the  \"Moses of the Latinos\" due to his many years advocating for immigrant rights.In his continued efforts to reform immigration, Guti\u00e9rrez has participated in two acts of non-violent civil disobedience outside of the White House. The first took place on May 1, 2010, where, following a speech delivered to hundreds at Lafayette Park, Guti\u00e9rrez marched with protesters to the White House and refused to leave until Presidential action was taken on immigration reform or he was arrested. Many of the protesters who joined Guti\u00e9rrez had signs that called for a Presidential moratorium on deportation and criticized recent anti-immigrant legislation passed in Arizona \u2013 SB 1070. Guti\u00e9rrez also joined the protesters in criticizing Arizona Governor Jan Brewer's decision to sign the measure allowing racial profiling in the state-level enforcement of immigration laws.On July 26, 2011, in response to a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama, and the President's continued refusal to stop deportations of DREAM Act eligible youth, Guti\u00e9rrez and eleven labor, faith, and civil rights leaders were arrested outside the White House. A crowd of 2,500 came to support Guti\u00e9rrez and the eleven other leaders. A day before the arrest, President Obama sent a letter to Guti\u00e9rrez in which he stated that he would continue his administration's deportation policy.In 2009, and again in 2011, Guti\u00e9rrez went on a nationwide tour in support of comprehensive immigration reform and a moratorium on the deportation of families. The tours have received widespread media attention and helped revive the nationwide discussion on immigration reform. Guti\u00e9rrez was the main speaker at the historic March 21, 2010, March for America rally at the capitol mall attended by over 200,000 people.Guti\u00e9rrez was the first elected official to sponsor a version of the DREAM Act \u2013 legislation to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States as minors a pathway to citizenship \u2013 in 2001. In 2009 Guti\u00e9rrez introduced CIR-ASAP \u2013 Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act \u2013 a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and improve border security. The bill received over 100 co-sponsors and was endorsed by members of the business community and organized labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Food and Commercial Workers, and the Service Employees International Union. He described the bill before a Washington DC rally: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}My bill will promote fair immigration proceedings, humane treatment of immigration detainees, and policies that respect the tenet of community policing. No more raids in our community, no more separation of our families. Now, none of this works without a strong commitment to America\u2019s labor force. None of it works without a strong commitment. So one of the tenets of our bill will be comprehensive immigration reform, has to mean\u2014has to mean\u2014to protecting all workers.\u2014\u2009Luis Guti\u00e9rrez,  Following CIR-ASAP's defeat in the Congress, Guti\u00e9rrez has been a main backer of the DREAM Act in the House.Guti\u00e9rrez called former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley a \"champion\" of immigration in 2014 when the two were working to oppose the White House's deportation policy.Veterans' access to health care This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification, as its only attribution is to self-published sources; articles should not be based solely on such sources.

(June 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)While Guti\u00e9rrez was a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the House passed legislation introduced by Guti\u00e9rrez that made treatment and counseling available to veterans who have been victims of sexual trauma. Guti\u00e9rrez also successfully expanded healthcare coverage to those exposed to Agent Orange and high levels of radiation during military service.Guti\u00e9rrez's assistance was pivotal in securing $92 million in additional healthcare and prosthetic funding for veterans.Puerto Rico Guti\u00e9rrez has been an advocate for human and civil rights of the Puerto Rican people. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was a leader in the Vieques movement, which sought to stop the United States military from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground. In May 2000, Guti\u00e9rrez was one of nearly two hundred people arrested (including fellow congresswoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez) for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range. Gutierrez was ultimately successful: in May 2003, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility on Vieques Island was closed; and in May 2004, the U.S. Navy's last remaining base on Puerto Rico, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station - which employed 1,000 local contractors and contributed $300 million to the local economy - was closed.In 2011, Guti\u00e9rrez came out against human rights abuses occurring on the island \u2013 specifically police brutality perpetrated against University of Puerto Rico students critical of the island's government and a law passed by the Fortu\u00f1o government that sought to limit student's freedom of speech. Guti\u00e9rrez also spoke out against a proposed pipeline which would degrade the island's lush tropical habitat and potentially put residents living near the proposed pipeline in danger.Workers' rights Guti\u00e9rrez is a close ally of organized labor and has voted repeatedly to protect and expand workers' rights. In 2008, Guti\u00e9rrez was one of the principal elected officials that assisted workers of the Chicago-based Republic Windows and Doors during their successful sit-in. The workers had lost their jobs without advance notice, allegedly due to a refusal of credit from Bank of America after the bailout of the financial system. He met with workers and helped them broker a deal with Bank of America. Guti\u00e9rrez views his advocacy for workers' rights and immigrant rights as invariably related. He is frequently invited to speak and present before labor unions.North American Free Trade Agreement In 1994 Guti\u00e9rrez was a vocal opponent of NAFTA and ultimately voted against the measure because of the legislation's failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against American job loss, and protect Mexican workers' collective bargaining rights.Public transportation This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification, as its only attribution is to self-published sources; articles should not be based solely on such sources.

The Douglas Branch is now known as the Pink Line (CTA).Use of civil disobedience With a background as a community activist and organizer, Guti\u00e9rrez often uses non-violent civil disobedience when pushing political causes and legislation. He was arrested in May 2000 in protest of the US military using the inhabited Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a bombing range, and again in May 2010 in protest of presidential inaction on immigration reform. In 2010 and 2011, he was arrested protesting presidential inaction on immigration reform and a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama.Criticism Guti\u00e9rrez's progressive political stances are often challenged by political commentators. Since 2008, Guti\u00e9rrez has been the subject of several critical stories in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, detailing his relationship with former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, and the real estate dealings of Gutierrez and his family.Committee assignments Upon arriving to the United States House of Representatives, Guti\u00e9rrez attempted to organize the 63 incoming Democratic freshmen to support a reform agenda. He sent each one a copy of the book Adventures in Porkland: How Washington Wastes Your Money and Why They Won't Stop. As a result of his attempts to organize the freshmen class, Guti\u00e9rrez was passed up by the House leadership for his first choice of the Ways and Means Committee, and his second choice of the Education Committee; instead, he was assigned to the Banking Committee and Veterans' Affairs. In response to being bypassed for his top committee choices as result of his reform advocacy, Guti\u00e9rrez charged that then-House Speaker Tom Foley was \"not a reformer in any sense\".Congressman Guti\u00e9rrez sits on the following House Committees:Judiciary CommitteeSubcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security,Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations;Guti\u00e9rrez was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the 110th and 111th Congress, serving on the Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Subcommittee. During that same period of time, he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Financial Services Committee.Guti\u00e9rrez  is a member of the House Baltic Caucus, the Congressional Arts Caucus and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus.", "Mayoral candidacy speculation": "Guti\u00e9rrez' name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for Mayor of Chicago. In 2006, he explored running for mayor of Chicago against incumbent Richard M. Daley, but announced in November that he would remain in Congress.After Daley declared his retirement in 2011, Guti\u00e9rrez' name was once again floated as a potential mayoral candidate. In an effort to draft the Congressman into the race, students formed chapters of \"Students for Luis Guti\u00e9rrez\" at six colleges and two Chicago public high schools; but in October, Guti\u00e9rrez removed his name from consideration, stating, \"I have an obligation not to give up on the fight I've already begun. I have unfinished business to complete\", in reference to his work on immigration reform in the United States Congress.", "Personal life": "Guti\u00e9rrez has been married to Soraida Arocho Guti\u00e9rrez for over thirty years.

From 1986 until his election to Congress, he served as a member of the Chicago City Council representing the 26th ward. He is a member of the Democratic Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In the 113th Congress, with his 20 years of service, Guti\u00e9rrez became, along with Bobby Rush, the longest serving member of the Illinois House delegation, and so is occasionally referred to as the unofficial \"dean\" of the delegation.\nOf Puerto Rican descent, he is a former supporter of Puerto Rican independence, and the Vieques movement. Guti\u00e9rrez is also an outspoken advocate of workers' rights, LGBT rights, gender equality, and other liberal and progressive causes. In 2010, Frank Sharry of America's Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, said of Guti\u00e9rrez: \"He's as close as the Latino community has to a Martin Luther King figure.\" His supporters have given him the nickname El Gallito \u2013 the little fighting rooster \u2013 in reference to his fiery oratory and political prowess.\nHis district, the 4th congressional district, was featured by The Economist as one of the most strangely drawn and gerrymandered congressional districts in the country and has been nicknamed \"earmuffs\" due to its shape. It was created to pack two majority Hispanic parts of Chicago into one district, thereby creating a majority Hispanic district.\nIn November 2017, Guti\u00e9rrez announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and not seek re-election in 2018.\n\n", "code": "04"}, "personal": {"Born": "Luis Vicente Guti\u00e9rrez (1953-12-10) December 10, 1953 (age64)Chicago, Illinois, U.S.", "Political party": "Democratic", "Spouse(s)": "Soraida Arocho", "Children": "2 daughters", "Education": "Northeastern Illinois University (BA)", "Signature": ""}, "timeline": {"Member of the US House of Representativesfrom Illinois's 4th district": {"date": "Assumed office January 3, 1993", "Preceded by": "George Sangmeister"}, "Member of the Chicago City Councilfrom Ward 26": {"date": "In officeMay 2, 1986\u2013 December 12, 1992", "Preceded by": "Michael Nardulli", "Succeeded by": "Billy Ocasio"}, "code": "04"}, "code": "", "type": "", "party": "", "description": "", "economic": "0", "social": "0", "leadership": "0"}
