{"name": "Richard.Shelby", "picture": "S000320.jpg", "detail": {"Early life, education, and early career": "Shelby was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of Alice L. (n\u00e9e Skinner) and Ozie Houston Shelby. He attended the University of Alabama, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1957. He attended the Birmingham School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor in 1961. He was admitted to the Alabama State Bar on August 29, 1961. He received an LL.B. from The University of Alabama in 1963.Shelby is a member of the American Bar Association and Alabama State Bar, as well as the American Judicature Society, Alabama Law Institute, Delta Chi Fraternity, and Phi Alpha Delta legal fraternity.Shelby was a city prosecutor in Tuscaloosa, Alabama from 1963 to 1971. From 1966 to 1970, Shelby was a U.S. Magistrate for the Northern District of Alabama; from 1969 to 1971, he was a Special Assistant State Attorney General.", "Alabama and US House political career, 1978\u20131986": "Shelby was elected to the Alabama Senate in 1970 and served until 1978. That year he ran for and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the Tuscaloosa-based 7th district. He was re-elected three times. Shelby was one of the more Conservative Democrats in Congress, and a member of the boll weevils, a group of moderate to conservative-leaning Democrats who often worked with Republican President Ronald Reagan on defense issues.", "US Senate": "Elections In 1986 U.S. Senate election in Alabama, Shelby won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat held by Republican Jeremiah Denton, the first Republican elected to the Senate from Alabama since Reconstruction. He won a very close race as the Democrats regained control of the Senate. He was easily re-elected in 1992 even as Bill Clinton lost Alabama's electoral votes.On November 9, 1994, Shelby switched his party affiliation to Republican, one day after the Republican Revolution in which they won control of both houses in the midterm elections, giving the Republicans a 53\u201347 majority in the Senate. He won his first full term as a Republican in 1998 by a large margin. He has since faced no significant opposition in 2004 or 2010. He was re-elected to a sixth term in 2016.A September 2009 poll showed Shelby had a 58% approval rating, with 35% disapproving.In 2014, The Wall Street Journal criticized Shelby for hoarding campaign and PAC contributions and not sharing them with other colleagues.Tenure 1980s In 1987, Shelby opposed President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, a move attributed to lobbying by Alabama African-American leaders who reminded Shelby that he had relied on support from black voters in narrowly defeating Denton in 1986. However, in 1991, Shelby supported President George H. W. Bush's conservative Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.1990s Shelby publicly feuded with President Bill Clinton during the first half of Clinton's first term. At a meeting with Vice President Al Gore, he turned to the TV cameras and denounced the Clinton program as \"high on taxes, low on [spending] cuts\".Shelby served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1995 to 2003, stepping down because of a Senate rule limiting committee terms to eight years. Shelby took an adversarial stance toward the intelligence community during both Clinton and Bush administrations. He helped sink Anthony Lake's nomination as CIA director in 1997 and promised to investigate the use of American-made satellites by the Chinese to gather intelligence. Shelby took a hard line on leaks of classified information. In 2000 he introduced a bill (vetoed by President Clinton) \"that would have broadened the law that criminalizes release of national defense information.\" According to the Washington Post:Civil liberties groups and news organizations, which argued that the legislation would chill their ability to get information from officials, lobbied for the veto. . . .In 2002, with George W. Bush in the White House, Shelby reintroduced his language, but then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft said that \"rigorous investigation\" and enforcement of existing laws\u2014not new legislation\u2014were the best way to fight leaks.In 1991 Shelby supported the 1991 Crime Bill S.1241 sponsored by then Senator Joseph Biden that instituted a national waiting period for handgun purchases as well as a federal ban on semi-automatic firearms.In January 1992, Shelby met with Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, advocating for the basic cost of money being reduced from 3.5 percent to 3 percent to assist with the stimulation of the economy. Shelby confirmed afterward that he intended to vote for Greenspan for another term as Federal Reserve Chair and said that Greenspan was not opposed to his suggestion to cut the discount rate to its lowest in twenty years in addition to agreeing with him on the need for a restoration of investment tax credits and a special tax rate for capital gains along with the providing of incentives to encourage savings.In 1999, he opposed the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed parts of the Glass\u2013Steagall Legislation, and was the only Republican Senator and one of eight Senators overall to vote against it.[note 1]2000s Shelby was highly critical of CIA Director George Tenet in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.From 2003 until 2007, he chaired the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. He is[when?] a member of the Appropriations Committee where he chaired its subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science and Special Committee on Aging.[citation needed] He lost his chairmanships in 2007 when the Democrats regained control of the Senate.In 2004, a federal investigation concluded that Shelby revealed classified information to the media when he was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Specifically, Shelby revealed classified information on June 19, 2002 to Carl Cameron, the chief political correspondent on Fox News. The information consisted of two messages between Al-Qaeda operatives intercepted by the National Security Agency on September 10, 2001, but not translated until the day after the attacks\u2014\"the match is about to begin\" and \"tomorrow is zero hour.\" The Department of Justice declined to file criminal charges against Shelby and transferred the case to the Senate Ethics Committee.  The committee in 2005 concluded its probe into the alleged leak.Shelby, in his role as chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs, opposed proposed legislation that would have permitted additional competition in the title insurance industry.Shelby is currently co-chair of the Congressional Privacy Caucus and Zero Capital Gains Tax Caucus. He is also the Senate co-chair of the National Security Caucus. In addition, he is a member of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Centrist Coalition.In February 2010, Shelby placed a hold on more than 70 of President Obama's nominees to various government posts, in a protest over an Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker contract and the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center. Shelby lifted all but three of the holds 3 days later, saying that \"The purpose of placing numerous holds was to get the White House's attention on two issues that are critical to our national security\u2014the Air Force's aerial refueling tanker acquisition and the FBI's Terrorist Device Analytical Center (TEDAC). With that accomplished, Sen. Shelby has decided to release his holds on all but a few nominees directly related to the Air Force tanker acquisition until the new Request for Proposal is issued.\" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticized Shelby for \"hold[ing] up qualified nominees for positions that are needed because he didn't get two earmarks\"; Shelby denied the holds were over earmarks.2010s This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Shelby's high campaign contribution spending has been criticized; from 2008 until 2014 he had reimbursed himself and his wife more than $500,000 from his campaign and leadership PACs. The Wall Street Journal called him a \"stingy lawmaker\".In August 2018, after Rand Paul proposed an amendment to tie a spending bill to the funding of Planned Parenthood, Shelby warned that the amendment could attract supporters while concurrently becoming a spoiler for a larger government spending bill.In September 2018, Shelby reported that the House and Senate were close to a deal on a third package of spending bills for 2019. Representative Nita Lowey disputed the claim, saying that she did not believe a deal would be reached until after the House adjourned and a Republican aide in the House of Representatives responded that there was no time to complete the package.Political views Gun law Shelby has an A+ rating, from the National Rifle Association for his support of gun rights. In 2016, Shelby voted against the Feinstein Amendment, which sought to stop the sale of firearms to people known or suspected to be terrorists. Upon being asked by Scott Wapner on why he voted against it, Shelby said \"I do believe that we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, would-be terrorists, and a lot of other people.\"After the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Shelby offered thoughts and prayers to victims, families and first responders on social media.Earmarks In 2010, Shelby initially opposed the Republican Party's moratorium on earmark funding.Space Shelby has supported development of the Space Launch System (SLS), but disagreed with how funds for the program have been spent. He favors competition for the strap-on booster design.  The SLS earmark has been opposed by fiscal conservative groups, including the Tea Party.  When President Obama decided to cancel Constellation, the Bush-era NASA program that was to provide the U.S.'s next manned rocket and instead give NASA a new $6 billion to ramp up a commercial space industry while NASA studies deep-space missions, Shelby ridiculed the plan as a \"faith-based initiative\".Finance Both under the Bush Administration, in 2008, and the Obama Administration, beginning in 2009, Shelby was vocal in his opposition to bailing out the banks and other corporations (such as AIG).In 2010, Shelby voted to block three amendments to regulate banks, including an amendment #3812 to S. 3217 to cap ATM fees at $0.50 per transaction, and to bar banks borrowing taxpayer money through TARP funds to use those funds for their own benefit. Shelby also believes that bank oversight violates the right to privacy and is against the Government Office of Financial Research being able to collect the financial data it needs to regulate the bank industry.In 2011, Shelby opposed the nomination of Nobel Economics Prize laureate and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Peter Diamond to serve on the board of the Federal Reserve, on the grounds that professor Diamond \"lacked the necessary qualifications\".Since becoming Senate Banking Chairman Shelby has made \"regulatory relief and financial regulation reform his top priority\". In May 2015, he revealed the so-called \"Shelby Bill\", easing regulatory restrictions on smaller banks and increasing scrutiny of the Federal Reserve.Abortion Shelby opposes abortion and has stated on his Senate campaign website that Roe v. Wade is \"...terribly flawed on both a constitutional and moral basis.\" Shelby also opposes taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and has voted against a short-term funding bill in Congress because it did not defund Planned Parenthood.Taxes He advocates a flat tax and supported the Bush Administration's tax cuts. He cites disagreements with the Democrats on tax policy as one of the main reasons he became a Republican; he feels the Democrats are too willing to enact tax increases.Shelby is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge.Health care Shelby opposed President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.Following Senator Ted Cruz's 21-hour speech opposing the Affordable Care Act, Shelby joined Cruz and 17 other Senators in a failed vote against cloture on a comprehensive government funding bill that would have also continued funding healthcare reform.Other Among the bills sponsored by Shelby over the years have been bills to make English the sole language of the federal government, to limit federal government spending by statute, and to provide a moratorium on certain forms of immigration, and to support a Federal Marriage Amendment.In 1999, Shelby was one of ten Republican senators to vote for the acquittal of President Bill Clinton on the charge of perjury when Clinton was tried in the Senate in 1999, although he voted for Clinton's conviction on the charge of obstruction of justice.Shelby opposed the initial bailout proposal to extend billions of dollars in loan money to the Big Three US auto manufacturers. He is often seen as a front man for the GOP Senate opposition. In late 2008, he opposed a Federal government bridge loan for US-owned auto companies, saying: \"We don't need government\u2014governmental subsidies for manufacturing in this country. It's the French model, it's the wrong road. We will pay for it. The average American taxpayer is going to pay dearly for this, if I'm not wrong.\"In 2017, Shelby was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Shelby has received more than $60,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012. In the December 2017 Alabama Senate special election, after the Republican nominee for the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, Roy Moore, was accused of molesting teenage girls as young as fourteen, Shelby stated on CNN that \"I think the Republican Party can do better\" and \"The state of Alabama deserves better.\" Shelby said he wrote in the name of another Republican on his general election absentee ballot. Shelby claimed to be \"relieved\" when Moore was defeated in the special election by Democrat Doug Jones.Interest group and ideological ratings This section needs to be updated.
