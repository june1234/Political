From his position on the Homeland Security Committee, he pushed for accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and a careful review of the role of the Red Cross in the time of disaster. He also pursued waste, fraud, and abuse in hurricane contracting and called for preferences to be given to small and Gulf Coast businesses in the recovery and rebuilding of the affected states. Thompson is the founding Member of the bipartisan Gulf Coast Recovery & Rebuilding Caucus in the House of Representatives.Thompson's voting record has been decidedly liberal; he is by far the most liberal member of the Mississippi delegation and arguably one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent the state. He is a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. His legislative platform focuses mainly on homeland security, civil rights, agriculture and rural issues, equal education and health care reform. In 1975, he became one of the original plaintiffs in the Ayers Case, which concerned the adequate funding of predominantly black educational institutes in Mississippi.

Thompson was particularly concerned about local officials getting adequate resources, having been a volunteer firefighter and a local elected official for 24 years.He was one of the 31 who voted in the House to refuse to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.Along with John Conyers, in April 2006, Thompson brought an action against George W.

The bill, cosponsored by more than 100 House Members, provided for the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's remaining recommendations. It included provisions requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; providing first responders the equipment and training they need; beefing up efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; and significantly expanding diplomatic, economic, educational, and other strategies designed to counter terrorism.

The bill proposed for auto insurance rates to be more based solely on factors related to \"skills and responsibility behind the wheel\", excluding of factors such as debt or poor credit elsewhere. The bill has not been enacted.Thompson has also been a supporter of a measure to increase screening and background checks for pilot trainees to reduce chances of terrorist exploitation. The bill, H.R. 6159 would require all applicants to go through a waiting period while they were screened and cleared by the Department of Homeland Security. Currently only foreign born trainees are required to go through this screening, but this bill would extend the precautions taken to all American applicants. The bill has not been enacted. Thompson joined hands with Senator Ron Wyden and introduced a bill to limit the number of documents that are classified and to overhaul the security clearance system in July 2014. The bill's fate is currently unclear.Legislation sponsored Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2013 (H.R. 1204; 113th Congress) \u2013 Thompson introduced this bill on March 14, 2013.
