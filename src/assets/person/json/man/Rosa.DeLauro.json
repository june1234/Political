As chair of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Food and Drug Administration, she has been a critic of that agency's failures to protect the public from unsafe foods and medical products.In May 2006, she was linked in press reports to U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd's potential bid for President in 2008.[clarification needed][citation needed] On February 2, 2008, DeLauro endorsed Illinois Senator Barack Obama for President.On October 3, 2008, DeLauro voted a second time in the House in favor the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

She supports the availability of abortions in all cases, along with the use of federal subsidies for abortion procedures. In 2006 she voted against HR 6099, a bill that would require abortion providers to follow specific procedures and formalities before performing abortions. In 2006 she also voted against a bill that makes it illegal to transport pregnant women under the age of 18 across state lines in order to obtain an abortion. DeLauro has faced criticism from the Roman Catholic Church, of which she is a member, over her pro-choice position.Gun issues She has voted in support of stronger regulation of firearms in the United States. In 2006 she voted against the Trigger Lock Amendment that ends the use of funds from the Commerce Department FY2007 Appropriation bill to enforce laws requiring guns to be sold with locks. DeLauro voted in 1999 to increase the amount of time given to perform background checks from 24 hours to 72 hours. Earlier, in 1998 she voted to increase the minimum gun crime sentence.

This bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a birth defects prevention, risk reduction, and awareness program. The program aims to increase awareness about pregnancy and breastfeeding by starting a nationwide media campaign and provides grants for research on certain exposures that affect pregnancy and breastfed infants. In November, 2010, this bill was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The bill was not voted on by the Senate.HR 875 DeLauro introduced HR 875, the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009.[needs update] This legislation is aimed at reforming the food safety responsibilities handled by the FDA. The introduction of this bill represents a potential conflict of interest, because of her husband's, Stanley Greenberg, relation to agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.Hurricane Irene In August 2011, the 3rd District suffered extreme damage when Hurricane Irene made landfall along the Connecticut coastline. Numerous homes were destroyed in East Haven and other shore communities and many Connecticut residents lost power for days. At the time Hurricane Irene hit the state and during the immediate aftermath, DeLauro was vacationing along Italy's Amalfi Coast and was not anticipated to return to the state until five days after the storm had passed. A Hartford Courant column rated DeLauro's storm response an \"F\". DeLauro told the New Haven Register she had \"no apology for taking a vacation\" and being out of state during the storm.Health care In July 2014, DeLauro introduced the Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Act, also known as the \"SWEET Act\", which would impose a 1 cent excise tax per teaspoon of caloric sweetener in soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweet teas (roughly 9 cents on a 12 oz. soda). \"This act is intended to discourage excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by increasing the price of these products,\" according to the text of the legislation. DeLauro and other supporters of the tax argued that it could help address the national epidemics of obesity and diabetes by discouraging consumers from consuming the products and also raise money to fund prevention and treatment programs and with research and dietary education to help reduce the costs of related health problems. The bill was subsequently co-sponsored by several House members and progressed on to the House Energy and Commerce committee for Health and the House Ways and Means committee, but went no further.The bill was opposed by the American Beverage Association and the National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) stating that \"People don't support taxes and bans on common grocery items, like soft drinks\" and that sweetened beverages \"are not the main source of added sugars for children and teens and that a tax on sugary drinks unfairly singles out the industry.\"Committee assignments Committee on AppropriationsSubcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related AgenciesSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee (Co-Chair for Steering)Caucus memberships Populist CaucusCongressional Arts CaucusAfterschool CaucusesCongressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus", "Personal life": "DeLauro is married to political strategist Stan Greenberg.DeLauro celebrated 25 years as an ovarian cancer survivor in 2010.
