Had the Clinton-Kaine ticket won the general election, Kaine would have resigned his Senate seat, and Democratic Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe would have been able to appoint a replacement to serve until a 2017 special election.  In August 2016, former Democratic governor Douglas Wilder stated that he would want McAuliffe to appoint Scott to the seat, stating that it "would be good for the commonwealth, good for the Democratic Party, of which Bobby has been most supportive, and great for our nation." On November 8, however, Clinton and Kaine lost the presidency to Donald Trump and Mike Pence, so Kaine remained in his Senate seat and an appointment was not necessary.', 'Electoral history': "Virginia's 1st congressional district: 1986 resultsYearDemocratVotesPctRepublicanVotesPct1986Bobby Scott63,36444%Herbert H.

Reese Everson), a former congressional fellow who had worked in Scott\'s office, alleged that Scott had sexually harassed her in 2013 by making inappropriate comments and touching her on the knee and back on separate occasions.  Scott dismissed Everson\'s accusation as a "false allegation."  Everson provided details of her claim at a news conference in Arlington, in which she appeared with attorney Jack Burkman, best known for his involvement in the conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich.A December 22, 2017 story in the Richmond Free Press questioned Everson\'s allegations. "Since 2015, Ms. Everson has told at least three different versions of events... In Facebook posts and in comments to the Free Press and other media outlets, scores of people have expressed certainty that Ms. Everson is more a fabricator than a truth teller."  Among the details that suggested conflicting accounts by Everson was that on November 19, 2010, the Inspector General\'s Office for the city of Chicago placed Everson on the city\'s "do not hire" list indefinitely (a permanent ban) after she was fired from their office.  In response, in 2011, Everson sued, accusing her former supervisor of sexual harassment; she dropped the suit after going to work at the U.S. House of Representatives.  In October 2013, Everson was dismissed from her fellowship with the House Financial Services Committee.  She had begun work for the committee after leaving Scott\'s office.  Before leaving Scott\'s office, she had a going away party with members of his staff; after leaving, she contacted Scott to thank him for the opportunity.  In neither case did she mention inappropriate conduct by Scott.  Further detracting from Everson\'s account of her interactions with Scott was a December 31, 2017 New York Times story that included Burkman in its discussion of politically motivated sexual harassment claims.', 'introduction': "Robert Cortez Scott (born April 30, 1947) is the U.S. Representative from Virginia's 3rd congressional district.
