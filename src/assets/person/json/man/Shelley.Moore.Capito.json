Byrd. Capito ultimately decided against a Senate bid, pointing out that, even though the West Virginia Legislature passed a law allowing her to run for both her House seat and the Senate, "running for two offices simultaneously is not who I am as a person. More importantly, this is not about me, but what is right for the people of West Virginia." Capito won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Virginia Lynch Graf, 68%–30%. For the first time in her career, she won all 18 counties of the district.2012 After redistricting, Capito was challenged in the Republican primary for the first time in her career.

Despite initial protests from Tea Party groups and anti-establishment conservatives that Moore Capito\'s House voting record was "too liberal", she ultimately won 87% of the Republican primary vote.Rockefeller dropped out of the race on January 11, 2013, making Capito the overwhelming favorite in the general election.She went on to defeat Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in the general election, 62% to 35% - the largest victory margin for a Republican running in a statewide race in West Virginia history. She also carried every county in the state.Tenure Capito has attributed her emphasis on bipartisanship and working through ideological differences as a reason for her successful political career, further demonstrated by her "willingness to break from her party by voting against tax breaks for oil companies and twice supporting an override of George W.

Conservatives have criticized her for being too centrist, and she has been at odds with the tea party movement by opposing funding cuts to various federal programs. She does not believe that Roe v. Wade should be overturned, but has voted to ban abortions after 20 weeks and has cast other antiabortion votes. Capito has also been a stalwart supporter of the coal industry, introducing mining safety measures and campaigning against the Environmental Protection Agency."Donald Trump\'s candidacy and presidency In 2016, Capito raised concerns about Trump\'s tone and rhetoric during the election.

According to Fox News, "Three Republican senators – Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine – have indicated they will not vote for a Supreme Court nominee who suggests he or she might not respect the precedent of earlier rulings allowing abortion".In 2017,  "West Virginians for Life, said [it] still supports Capito, despite the abortion rights self-identification and support for Roe v. Wade, because of Capito\'s steadfast voting record restricting abortions and defunding Planned Parenthood". In 2018, West Virginians for Life endorsed a ballot initiative to ban abortion in the event that Roe is overturned; Capito said she is "not going to openly support or oppose" the ballot initiative. Capito supported Trump\'s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh; when asked about Roe v Wade, "Capito said she does not think the court will overturn the ruling. \'Fundamentally, it\'s been a precedent for a long time,\' she said." She said that the precedent was a factor in her consideration.Sexual assault Capito is partnering with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand, Patty Murray, Amy Klobuchar and other bipartisan congresspeople to update the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, that would "help prevent sexual harassment and discrimination in Congress and create more transparency and accountability in the reporting process for survivors."Embryonic stem-cell research Senator Capito supports embryonic stem cell research.

Bill), which expanded the educational benefits for military veterans who have served since September 11, 2001.On March 3, 2017, Capito "insist[ed] that Medicaid expansion be preserved in the GOP\'s Obamacare replacement proposal". Along with three other Republicans, Capito signed a letter saying that the House Republican health care plan "does not do enough to protect families and individuals covered by the Medicaid expansion or to provide flexibility to the states". Capito was one of the Republicans suggesting that "the Republican healthcare proposals are too conservative." She came out against the Better Care Reconciliation Act because of her opposition to a conservative amendment to the bill as well as over opioid issues.Capito announced that she is opposed to repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) without a replacement proposal.

She is encouraged by ongoing negotiations between the Trump Administration and members of Congress to improve immigration policy and add resources for enforcement."Capito voiced disagreement with Trump\'s "zero-tolerance" policy that included separating children from their parents or guardians. She said "we need to keep the families together," speaking to the media.
